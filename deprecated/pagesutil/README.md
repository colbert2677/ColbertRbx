# PagesUtil

A module primarily intended to resolve the issue of the Roblox Creator Documentation code sample for iterating pages containing a breaking yield (done by expanding the pages into an array of elements and then iterating that way).

The package uploaded at this scope is no longer maintained and neither are its other versions.
