All of these modules are best acquired by adding the relevant dependency line in your project\'s Wally dependencies file (wally.toml). You may also visit the repository and inspect the source code directly. A number of packages have other Wally packages as dependencies so it\'s more strongly recommended to install them from Wally than to copy the source code into your project folders by yourself.","sidebar":"defaultSidebar"}}}')}}]);
