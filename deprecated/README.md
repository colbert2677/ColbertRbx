# Deprecated

This directory contains all packages that are no longer maintained and are preserved in their final versions (versions are each bumped to their next major version). The documentation may be out of date and the packages themselves unworking. They continue to remain on the Wally public registry for consumption.

It is strongly recommended that no packages from this area are used and are merely looked at as potential reference. Pulls in this directory may only be made if I'm feeling bothered by some of the warnings that LSPs produce however the changes will not appear on the registry.
