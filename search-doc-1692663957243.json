Aftman is a toolchain manager for project-specific command line tools. Command line tools help empower unique workflows and powerful abilities to go with your development experience. Having Aftman installed is great for quickly pulling in the relevant tools you need like Rojo and Wally without any hassle or confusion on downloading files or running special programs in a consistent manner. Once you have Aftman, you can add Rojo and Wally as tools in your Aftman configuration file (aftman.toml). You can create an Aftman manifest by running aftman init and filling it out with the tool lines for Rojo and Wally. [tools] rojo = &quot;rojo-rbx/rojo@7.2.1&quot; wally = &quot;UpliftGames/wally@0.3.1&quot;  Once you've filled out the tools, run aftman install to install the tools. This will allow you to use commands for Rojo and Wally in your command line tool while its pointing towards the project directory. Think of it like a admin commands and chatting :cmds to see a list of commands but instead the prefix is a tool and your desired command (e.g. rojo help to see a list of Rojo commands). "},{"title":"Rojo Visual Studio Code Extension​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/ColbertRbx/docs/intro#rojo-visual-studio-code-extension","content":"If you're using Visual Studio Code (VSC) (I sure hope so!), you may find it helpful to install the Rojo VSC extension. You can find it in the marketplace as evaera.vscode-rojo (just searching Rojo will also produce the result). Note that if you don't have Rojo installed already, the extension will ask if you want it to install Rojo automatically for you which it also does through Aftman. "},{"title":"Wally Configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/ColbertRbx/docs/intro#wally-configuration","content":"Once you have Wally installed, run wally init to create a Wally package manifest for your project (wally.toml). The created manifest makes your directory an unpublished Wally package and can serve two purposes: for experience developers this file is a configuration file to list which packages you want to use in your codebase, while for open source module developers this file both sets out important details about your module for the Wally package registry and what other packages it may rely on. Experience developers only need to modify below the dependencies line, while open source module developers should consult the manifest format and fill out all the details appropriately. Do not publish the manifest for experience development If you're only using Wally to get packages for an experience's codebase, do not publish the created manifest. Publishing is for developers who are writing open source modules for the Wally registry, not for publishing your experience to Roblox. Don't make the mistake of uploading your entire experience's codebase to the registry. To grab any package in ColbertRbx, add its dependency line under your package's dependencies section. Dependency lines can be found on the home page or in the Wally registry (type colbert2677/ to see packages I've uploaded and click the desired package to find the line on the package page). As an example, your Wally package may look like this if you want to install ReplicationUtils: [package] name = &quot;your_computer_account_name/your_project_name&quot; version = &quot;0.1.0&quot; registry = &quot;https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally-index&quot; realm = &quot;shared&quot; [dependencies] ReplicationUtils = &quot;colbert2677/ReplicationUtils@0.1.0&quot;  Use PascalCase on the left side If you grabbed the dependency line from the Wally registry, the left side of the equals sign will be lowercase. It's recommended that you change the casing to PascalCase. When syncing packages into Roblox Studio with Rojo as will be explained later, the left side is what the actual instance name will be. -- Using PascalCase local ReplicationUtils = require(Packages.ReplicationUtils) -- Using lowercase local ReplicationUtils = require(Packages.replicationutils)  Once you've picked out the packages you want for your project, pull up your terminal of choice again and run wally install on the project's root folder. This will create a Packages folder in your project directory where all the packages you've picked out will be installed. This command also creates a Wally lockfile (wally.lock): see Wally Lockfile Format for more information on its importance. In other words, don't delete it. Do not commit the Packages folder with Git Make sure to add Packages/ to your .gitignore file (or create one if you don't have one). The Packages folder contains the actual Luau code as well as require redirects of each Wally package. If you do not have the Packages folder in your gitignore, you will generate changes each time you run wally install to add, update or remove packages. You ideally want to keep commits clean, specific and small for reviewing, revising and undoing, as well as only have commits against files you're writing. There aren't many cases where you want to have auto-generated files committed into version control. The only Wally-generated files you should be committing changes for are wally.toml and wally.lock. "},{"title":"Rojo Configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/ColbertRbx/docs/intro#rojo-configuration","content":"After installing the packages with Wally, you should add the Packages folder to your Rojo project file so that the packages can be synced into Studio. It's strongly recommended that you have them install to their own folder in ReplicatedStorage so they can be accessed by all peers (server and clients) and so they can remain independent of other code in your project folder. Leave the automatically managed files to their own container. Here's an example of what you may expect to write for your Rojo project: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;colbertrbx-example&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;DataModel&quot;, &quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;: { &quot;$className&quot;: &quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;, &quot;Packages&quot;: { &quot;$path&quot;: &quot;Packages&quot; } } } }  "},{"title":"Using Packages in Roblox​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/ColbertRbx/docs/intro#using-packages-in-roblox","content":"Now that you've completed the Rojo and Wally portions of installing packages, you're ready to use them right away just like any other modules. Unless you're doing anything special, Packages are considered static files in your Roblox place so you can access them directly from the server or client without any WaitForChild. -- Declare your services: local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService(&quot;ReplicatedStorage&quot;) local Players = game:GetService(&quot;Players&quot;) -- Reference the folder containing the packages: local Packages = ReplicatedStorage.Packages -- Require the packages you want to use: local ReplicationUtils = require(Packages.ReplicationUtils) -- Use the modules: local function playerAdded(player) local function characterAdded() ReplicationUtils:Replicate(player.Character) end player.CharacterAdded:Connect(characterAdded) if player.Character then characterAdded() end end Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(playerAdded) for _, player in ipairs(Players:GetPlayers()) do playerAdded(player) end  "},{"title":"Next Steps​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Getting Started","url":"/ColbertRbx/docs/intro#next-steps","content":"Go have a look around at some of the packages offered by ColbertRbx and their API here.
