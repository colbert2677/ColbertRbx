# ColbertRbx

A collection of public code resources written or modified for Roblox. This is a heavily experimental repository primarily intended for my own use but also available for others to use as well. As ColbertRbx is my first dip into the open source contribution space, there might be a lot of bad practices including this mono-repository with all packages available as directories rather than separate repositories, moonwave-incompatible naming, bad use of semver, some unfinished works rather than release-ready packages (check ReplicationUtils as an example of how I ended up publishing a few versions with minimal changes between them) and other such issues.

Please note: deprecated packages will remain on the Wally registry using a bumped major version prior to their final release however they will not show up in the documentation - API only includes actively maintained packages (for now, as it's clearer to me to know what I continue to maintain or not, since some packages may simply have been moved to a newer scope where they continue to be worked on) You will have to manually view the documentation of deprecated packages by going to the *deprecated* directory in the GitHub repository.
