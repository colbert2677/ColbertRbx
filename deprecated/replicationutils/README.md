# ReplicationUtils

A port of tyridge77's ReplicationUtils module to Wally with some light modifications such as avoiding conflicts with attribute use, use the popular Promise package by evaera instead of a custom implementation and (admittedly unnecessary) Promise-related configurations.

Several mistakes were made while porting this to Wally (including breaking semver and bumping versions for very small wordsmithing, no testing, no workflows and a poor naming convention). As such, the package uploaded at this scope is no longer maintained and neither are its other versions.
